The History of Us by Shawn DelPercio.

This application lets users create markers with comments of their own history on a google maps' map. Users can also see other users histories!

First, there is a splash page asking a user to sign up. Once clicked, the user can either sign up with a unique username, or log in if they already have an account. Then, the user will be brought to the index page with the google map.
Markers will be loaded from a sqlite3 database and displayed across the world. Users can then click on a point in the world to add their own message to share!
